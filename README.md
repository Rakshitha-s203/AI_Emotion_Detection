This project is an AI-based Emotion Detection and Recommendation System that uses computer vision and deep learning to analyze facial expressions in real time through a webcam. It detects the user's dominant emotion, calculates a confidence score, stabilizes predictions using temporal smoothing, and provides emotion-based suggestions along with dynamic colored UI and emoji display. The system is developed using Python with libraries such as OpenCV, DeepFace, and Pillow. To ensure proper dependency management and avoid version conflicts, the project is executed inside a virtual environment, which isolates required libraries and maintains compatibility with the Python interpreter version used for development.
